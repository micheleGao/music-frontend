# (Getting Jiggy) Music Frontend

An application for all music lovers. 

## Description of Getting Jiggy
A web application where all music lover band together and leave reviews on their available artists, using the API call from Django Rest Framework (Getting Jiggy backend). You can see the videos hosted by react player from youtube. Search for the available songs from the API. Leave a review, edit, or delete them using the given credentials dependent on the user information. 

### Inspiration  for the project
To have an application of all my favorite songs, and videos in one place, and be able to leave a review with full CRUD!

## Wireframing for the components

## My MVP Goals
- Have a fully functional review section where users can CRUD it up!
- To view all artists available from the API call.
- To have a song page, where all the songs avialable are displayed.

## Stretch Goals
- To have a search bar
- To have just a page of MP3 music for playlists
- To have songs have their own reviews


### Complications during the project
- Once deployed some of the CRUD functionality isn't working properly
- Using bootstrap for some of the modals some of the components were overlapping
- Styling

## Technologies Used.
1. JS
2. React Bootstrap
3. React Player

#All videos were rendered from youtube.com, and all photos used were from wikipedia.
